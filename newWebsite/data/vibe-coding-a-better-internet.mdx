# Vibe Coding A Better Internet

*This post is currently in draft. Coming soon...*

## The Evolution of Web Development

The internet has always been shaped by the tools we use to build it. From hand-coded HTML to modern frameworks, each era of tooling has democratized web development a little more. Now, with AI-assisted coding, we're entering a new phase.

## What is "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe coding" is about expressing intent and letting AI handle the implementation details. It's collaborative, iterative, and surprisingly powerful. But it's also changing what it means to be a web developer.

## Topics We'll Explore

- **The democratization of web development**: How AI tools are lowering barriers to entry
- **Intent-driven development**: Writing code by describing what you want, not how to build it
- **The new role of developers**: From implementers to architects and prompt engineers
- **Quality concerns**: Can vibe-coded applications be maintainable and secure?
- **The creative renaissance**: How easier development could lead to more diverse, experimental web experiences

## Why This Matters for MCP-B

MCP-B is itself a product of this new development paradigm. By making it easier to connect AI agents to web applications, we're enabling a new generation of developers to build sophisticated, agent-ready applications without deep technical expertise.

## Coming Soon

This article is currently being written and will include:

- Real examples of vibe-coded projects
- Interviews with developers using AI assistants
- Best practices for AI-assisted web development
- The future of development tools and workflows

Stay tuned!

# Agents are not Users

*This post is currently in draft. Coming soon...*

## Overview

AI agents and human users interact with software in fundamentally different ways. While we've spent decades perfecting user interfaces, user experience, and human-computer interaction, the rise of AI agents demands we rethink these assumptions from the ground up.

## What This Post Will Cover

- The key differences between how humans and agents interact with systems
- Why traditional UI/UX patterns don't work for agents
- How to design APIs and interfaces that serve both humans and agents effectively
- The implications for authentication, authorization, and security
- Real-world examples of agent-first design patterns

## Why This Matters

As AI agents become more prevalent in our digital ecosystem, understanding these differences will be crucial for:

- **Developers** building the next generation of web applications
- **Product designers** creating experiences that work for both humans and machines
- **Security engineers** protecting systems from new types of threats
- **Business leaders** planning for an agent-driven future

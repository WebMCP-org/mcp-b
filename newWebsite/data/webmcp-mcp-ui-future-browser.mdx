# WebMCP, MCP-UI and the future of the browser

*This post is currently in draft. Coming soon...*

## The Browser as a Platform

The browser has evolved from a simple document viewer to a full-fledged application platform. Now, with Model Context Protocol, it's becoming something even more powerful: a bridge between humans, AI agents, and the web itself.

## What This Post Will Explore

### WebMCP: The Standard

How WebMCP is establishing standards for:
- Browser-based MCP implementations
- Cross-site tool composition
- Security and permission models
- Developer experience and tooling

### MCP-UI: The Interface Layer

The emerging patterns for:
- Visualizing AI agent interactions
- Designing agent-aware interfaces
- Building hybrid experiences for humans and agents
- Real-time feedback and monitoring

### The Future Browser

What browsers might look like when:
- Every site can be an MCP server
- Agents navigate the web like APIs
- Users orchestrate tools across multiple sites
- The line between UI and API blurs

## Key Topics

- **Technical architecture**: How WebMCP fits into the browser ecosystem
- **Developer experience**: Tools and patterns for building MCP-enabled sites
- **User experience**: What browsing looks like in an agent-first world
- **Standards and governance**: Who decides how the agentic web evolves
- **Privacy and security**: Protecting users in a world of autonomous agents

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about MCP-B or any single project. It's about recognizing that the web is undergoing another fundamental shift, and we have the opportunity to shape what comes next.

## Coming Soon

This article will include:
- Technical deep-dives into WebMCP protocols
- Demos of experimental MCP-UI patterns
- Interviews with browser vendors and standards bodies
- A vision document for the future of agent-web interaction
